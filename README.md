### What I learned

I learned how to use svg files as icons and how to get better on building responsive layouts using max-width and unit sizes like em and rem:


```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1em;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 2em;
  max-width: 20rem;
  background-color: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
  border-radius: 1rem;
  font-size: 0.9rem;
}
```
